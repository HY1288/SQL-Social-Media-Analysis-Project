# SQL-Social-Media-Analysis-Project

## Project Summary:-
This project simulates a social media database to analyze various user behaviors and engagement metrics. It explores insights into user activity, interactions, and content creation on a social media platform. The project consists of several interconnected tables, including users, photos, comments, likes, follows, tags, and associations between photos and tags. The goal is to address specific business queries relevant to understanding user engagement, content popularity, and platform trends.


## Key Features and Insights

### User Engagement and Registration Patterns
* Identified the oldest users to reward them with a premium tag.
* Analyzed registration trends by day of the week to optimize ad campaign scheduling.

### User Activity Analysis
* Detected inactive users who have never posted photos, enabling targeted re-engagement campaigns.
* Determined the top users by the number of photo posts and identified the average posts per user.

### Content Popularity
* Ranked the most popular photos based on likes and identified the top photo with the highest number of likes to reward in a contest.
* Evaluated the top 5 most-used hashtags to assist brands in selecting popular tags for better visibility.

### User Types: Bots and Celebrities
* Analyzed the platform for "bots" who liked every photo and "celebrities" who have never commented.
* Calculated the percentage of users who fit these categories to gauge engagement quality and user authenticity.

### User Engagement Metrics
* Compared the proportion of users who have never commented against those who have commented at least once to assess overall platform interactivity.

This project provides valuable insights for marketing, product development, and community management teams, helping drive decisions to improve user engagement, target advertisements, and develop re-engagement campaigns for inactive users. The structured SQL queries serve as a robust foundation for analyzing user behavior and could be expanded to support larger-scale data analysis.
